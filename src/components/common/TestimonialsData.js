My father, who bares the cost of my semester fee, is far more relieved now looking at the monthly instalment vouchers instead of the lumpsome amount at the start of the semester. ”",

        review: "“ KalPay allowed me to continue with higher education without going under hefty debt. The payment plan helped me in covering my tuition fee without paying substantial interest payments which were offered by the banks. This facility has helped me in completing my education while taking care of my family in these financially challenging times. Paying in several instalments made it easier to manage the finances. It would not have been possible for me to cover the payment plans offered by the banks and the process was lengthy. KalPay’s process from start till the payment of fee was transparent. I would not have been able to continue with my degree if KalPay had not helped. KalPay can help a lot of deserving students in completing their education while putting away the financial burden. Thank you for helping. ”",

        review: "“ With the sole salary of our father, it has always been difficult to bear our educational cost.  As I was in dire need of a lump sum amount for my semester fee at LUMS, I turned to KalPay Taaleem with the hope of finding a solution. Not only did Kal pay Taaleem pay my semester fee, but it did in such a flexible way that I can’t even imagine. Its customer service is amazing. And I did not have to worry about the deadline because my fee was paid within 3 days of my application. Now all I need to do is just pay the small monthly instalments which is way easier than the huge lump sum amount. ”",

I am a student at LUMS who paid her semester fees through KalPay Taleem fee instalments. The best part about that was getting the approval instantly and not waiting for the amount to be transferred as they paid directly to the university. I was hesitant in the beginning but now KalPay has become my buddy for the future. ”",

Their streamlined and hassle-free process, empowered me to take control of my master's finances independently at the age of 23, freeing me from family pressure and to switch towards a higher-paying job while also continuing my education stress-free. I recommend KalPay for a convenient and reliable educational finance solution. ”",

Given the substantial financial burden our parents face, covering the expenses for both of us at LUMS and other obligations, Kalpay has been a lifesaver.

We're relieved to have found such a user-friendly solution during this challenging time. Kalpay has truly lightened our load and allowed us to focus on our studies with a little less worry. ”",
